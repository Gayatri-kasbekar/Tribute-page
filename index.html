                <h2>"Peace begins with a smile"</h2>
                <p>Mother Teresa, known as Saint Teresa of Calcutta, was born on August 26, 1910, in Skopje, now the capital of North Macedonia. Her birth name was Agnes Gonxha Bojaxhiu. At the age of 18, she left home to join the Sisters of Loreto, an Irish community of nuns with missions in India. She took the name Sister Mary Teresa after Saint Thérèse of Lisieux.</p>

                <p>In 1946, Mother Teresa experienced what she described as a "call within a call" from Jesus, urging her to leave the convent and serve the poorest of the poor. She founded the Missionaries of Charity in 1950, a congregation dedicated to serving the "hungry, the naked, the homeless, the crippled, the blind, the lepers, all those people who feel unwanted, unloved, uncared for throughout society, people that have become a burden to the society and are shunned by everyone."</p>
                    
                <p>The Missionaries of Charity grew from a small congregation in Calcutta to a global network with over 4,500 sisters operating in 133 countries by the time of Mother Teresa's death. The congregation runs hospices and homes for people with HIV/AIDS, leprosy, and tuberculosis; soup kitchens; children's and family counseling programs; orphanages; and schools.</p>
                    
                <p>Mother Teresa's work garnered international acclaim, and she received numerous awards, including the Nobel Peace Prize in 1979. Despite her fame, Mother Teresa remained humble, living a life of simplicity and devotion to her cause. She died on September 5, 1997, in Calcutta, India. In 2016, Mother Teresa was canonized as a saint by the Catholic Church for her humanitarian work and dedication to serving the poorest of the poor.</p>
